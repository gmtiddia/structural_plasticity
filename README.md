# A theoretical framework for learning through structural plasticity
This repository contains the data and scripts used for the preprint: *A theoretical framework for learning through structural plasticity*, DOI: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.11735

## Requirements
To run the simulations, C++ and GSL library is required. We used C++ version 10.2.0 and GSL 2.7 to obtain the results reported in the work above.
<br>
Additionally to run the scripts to post process the data and generate plots, Python and additional packages are required. To run the data post processing scripts and plotting scripts the following software was used:
* Python 3.10
* Numpy 1.21.5
* Pandas 1.3.5
* Scipy 1.8.0
* Matplotlib 3.5.1

## Contents
The [illustrations](illustrations/) directory contains the source and the PNG files of the illustrations shown in the work.
The [model](model/) directory contains all the scripts needed to perform the simulations of the model. Please enter the directory to have instructions on how to run a simulation.
The [plot](plot/) directory contains all the Python scripts used to produce the plots shown in the manuscript.
The [simulations](simulations/) directory contains the data, obtained from the simulations, that we used in the work.
